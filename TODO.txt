- The "EXPLAIN" and "SELECT" pages seem too small and require me to scroll horizontally.

- There is no indicator of what request I am currently looking at. I have to remember which one I clicked on right now.

- Tables have no styling.

- Currently both the "Panels" section in "History" and "Global" sections is clickable.

- Too much horizontal screen real-estate is occupied by drilling down into the data. I strongly urge you to make the "Panels" section of "History" into horizontal tabs across the top.

- If cell values are left-justified, the headers for those columns should also be left-justified. A lot of times the "Value" header is floating way far away from the actual column data horizontally.

- In the "Global" panel there is dead space where the "Panels" section is currently located in the "History" section, even though there is no panel there.
