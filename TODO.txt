- Docs.

- Clean up the static/img dir

- Solve the js content/deps managment

- Clean up the toolbar.css

- The "EXPLAIN" and "SELECT" pages seem too small and require me to scroll horizontally.

- There is no indicator of what request I am currently looking at. I have to remember which one I clicked on right now.

- Tables have no styling.

- Too much horizontal screen real-estate is occupied by drilling down into the data. I strongly urge you to make the "Panels" section of "History" into horizontal tabs across the top.

- If cell values are left-justified, the headers for those columns should also be left-justified. A lot of times the "Value" header is floating way far away from the actual column data horizontally.

- Version panel should  be active

- HTTP Headers panel should be active and content should be shown
